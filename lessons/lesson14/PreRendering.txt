PreRendering-----> 
* Pre-render just means render in advance of sending it to the browser.

* Pre-rendering is done by default in a Next JS app.

compare the page souce or html which is served to the browser by both these app--->

React-app ===> 
* start react app 
* inspect the element 
* right click and view page source code 
* here we only see a div tag with id equal to root, other elements are nowhere to found. 
* so the html page send from the server is sort of empty and doesn't contain any data or content that we see on the browser. 


Next-app ===> 
* start the next app 
* view page source code 
* here we see all the elements 

=== this right here is the difference between traditional react app and next-app 




*********** Pre-rendering ****************

React vs Next js
- By default, Next JS pre-renders every page in the application.


what does pre-render mean?
Next JS generates HTML for every page in advance instead of having it all done by client-side-Javascript


Why pre-render?
* pre-rendering improves performance
  |
  ---> In a react app, you need to wait for the Javascript to be executed.
  ---> Perhaps fetch data from the server and render the UI.
  ---> There is a wait time for the user.
  ---> With a pre-rendered page, the HTML is already generated and loads faster.


* Pre-rendering helps with SEO
  |
  ---> if you are building a blog or e-commerce site, SEO is concern.
  ---> With a React app, if the search engine hits your page, it only sees a div tag with id equal to root.
  ---> if search engine hits a pre-rendered page though, all the content is preset in the source code which will help index that page.
  ---> if SEO is of concern for your app, pre-rendering is what you want.
